### Hi there 👋


- Currently contributing to Gentoo Linux, the Linux Kernel, and various Linux packages
- Actively looking for bugs in various Linux packages
- I'm always compiling packages. No precompiled binaries at all
- I'm not looking to be a major contributor or actively develop/co-develop any project right now. I contribute when and if I have the time. Do not contact me for that.
- For bug testing/hunting, regressions, reproducing, compilations, and contributions that don't require major time commitment, reach out to me through email.
